/** 
 *
 * Move Zeroes Right
 *
 * Given an array nums and an integer target, you need to move the element which equal to target to the front of the array,
 * and the order of the remain elements can not be changed.
 * 
 * 
 * All your move operations should be performed on the original array.
 * 
 * Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [5, 1, 6, 1], target = 1
 * Output: [1, 1, 5, 6]
 * Explanation: 1 is target, so you should keep them in the front of array.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [-1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 2] target = 2
 * Output: [2, 2, 2, -1, 3, 5]
 * Explanation: 2 is target, so you should keep them in the front of array.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: nums = [2, 3, 4, 6] target = 1
 * Output: [2, 3, 4, 6]
 * Explanation: 1 is not target, so you should not change the array.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * The length of array is within range: [1, 100000]
 * If the target does not appear in the array, there is no need to modify the original array.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you minimize the total number of operations done?
